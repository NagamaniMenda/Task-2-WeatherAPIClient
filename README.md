### **Overview of Java REST API**

Java REST API development involves creating web services that conform to the REST (Representational State Transfer) architectural style. These APIs allow applications to interact with one another over the web, typically using HTTP as the protocol. Java provides robust frameworks and tools, such as Spring Boot, JAX-RS, and Jersey, to simplify REST API creation and management.

### **Objective of Java REST API Development**
The primary goal of creating a REST API in Java is to enable seamless communication between different software systems, including:
- **Data Sharing**: Facilitate the exchange of data between applications.
- **Interoperability**: Ensure systems built with different technologies can communicate effectively.
- **Scalability**: Design APIs to handle varying levels of load efficiently.
- **Ease of Integration**: Provide endpoints that are simple for developers to consume and integrate into their applications.
- **Modularity**: Structure applications into distinct services that can be updated or replaced independently.


### **Key Activities in Java REST API Development**

1. **Requirement Analysis**:
   - Understand the business needs and define the API's purpose.
   - Identify the resources and actions needed (e.g., CRUD operations).

2. **API Design**:
   - Define endpoints, HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and request/response formats.
   - Follow RESTful principles like statelessness and resource-based URLs.

3. **Framework and Tool Selection**:
   - Choose a suitable Java framework like Spring Boot, JAX-RS, or Jersey.
   - Use tools like Postman for testing and Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation.

4. **Implementation**:
   - Set up the server-side application with Java frameworks.
   - Implement endpoints, request handling, and data processing logic.
   - Integrate with databases or other services as needed.

5. **Testing**:
   - Perform unit, integration, and system tests to ensure the API works as expected.
   - Validate edge cases and error handling.

6. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the API to a production server or cloud platform.
   - Use containerization tools like Docker or Kubernetes for scalability and reliability.

7. **Monitoring and Maintenance**:
   - Monitor API performance using tools like Prometheus or New Relic.
   - Update and maintain the API as requirements evolve.
  
  
### **Technologies Commonly Used in Java REST API Development**

Java REST API development typically involves a combination of frameworks, libraries, tools, and infrastructure components. Below is an overview of the key technologies used:

### **1. Frameworks for Building APIs**
- **Spring Boot**:
  - A popular framework for creating standalone, production-ready REST APIs with minimal configuration.
  - Includes features like dependency injection, embedded servers, and integration with JPA and Hibernate.
- **JAX-RS** (Java API for RESTful Web Services):
  - A standard specification for building RESTful APIs in Java.
  - Implementations include:
    - **Jersey**: A reference implementation for JAX-RS.
    - **RESTEasy**: A JAX-RS implementation provided by Red Hat.
- **Micronaut**:
  - A lightweight framework optimized for microservices and serverless functions.
- **Quarkus**:
  - A Kubernetes-native framework optimized for Java REST APIs and cloud environments.

### **2. Tools for API Testing and Documentation**
- **Postman**:
  - A widely used tool for testing and debugging APIs.

***DELIVERABLE: A JAVA PROGRAM THAT HANDLES HTTP REQUESTS AND PARSES JSON RESPONSES.***

 **Code Implementation**

//java
import java.net.URI;
import java.net.http.HttpClient;
import java.net.http.HttpRequest;
import java.net.http.HttpResponse;
import org.json.JSONArray;
import org.json.JSONObject;

public class RestApiHandler 
{
public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Replace with your API endpoint and key (if required)

      
   String city = "London"; // Example: Fetch weather for London
   
 String apiKey = "your_api_key"; // Replace with your API key
 
String apiUrl = "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=" + city + "&appid=" + apiKey + "&units=metric";

   try {
             Step 1: Create an HTTP client
             
   HttpClient client = HttpClient.newHttpClient();

   Step 2: Create an HTTP request
            HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
                    .uri(URI.create(apiUrl))
                    .GET()
                    .build();

  Step 3: Send the request and get the response
HttpResponse<String> response client.send(request,HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());

   Step 4: Parse JSON response
            if (response.statusCode() == 200) {
                String responseBody = response.body();
                JSONObject jsonResponse = new JSONObject(responseBody);

  Extract weather description
                JSONArray weatherArray = jsonResponse.getJSONArray("weather");
String weatherDescription = weatherArray.getJSONObject(0).getString("description");

  Extract temperature
                double tempCelsius = jsonResponse.getJSONObject("main").getDouble("temp");

   Display extracted data
                System.out.println("City: " + city);
                System.out.println("Weather: " + weatherDescription);
                System.out.println("Temperature: " + tempCelsius + "Â°C");
            } else {
                System.out.println("Failed to fetch data. HTTP status code: " + response.statusCode());
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("An error occurred: " + e.getMessage());
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
